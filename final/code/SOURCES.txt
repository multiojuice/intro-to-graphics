Summary:
    Most of my changes are in Materials, Application, Models. Small changes in Lighting and Viewing 
    and the addition of multiple files, models, and orchestrating more objects.


Files from earlier frameworks: 
    Unaltered:
        From Lab7:
            Application.h
            Canvas.cpp & Canvas.h
            Buffers.cpp & Buffers.h
            compmac
            inverse.glsl
            Lighting.cpp
            Lighting.h
            main.cpp
            Materials.h
            Models.h
            QuadData.h
            ShaderSetup.cpp & ShaderSetup.h
            Types.h
            Utils.cpp & Utils.h           
            Viewing.cpp & 

        From Lab6:
            TeapotData.h -> I just renamed the file and moved stuff around

        Course Website Meshes:
            Cube10.h
            Parts.h
            Sphere20.h
        
    Altered:
        Based on Lab7:
            Application.cpp
            Materials.cpp
            Models.cpp
            p150.vert -> phong.vert
            p150.frag -> phong.frag
            texture.frag & texture.vert -> Based on the same version that I submitted for lab7


Image files: 


Object model files: 
    Basket.obj -> Created with Blender by hand with the help of some internet tutorials and friends that are familiar with the oddities of blender. 
        I got stuck in some weird selector mode for like 20 minutes lol. Then I parsed the .obj into BasketData.h similar to last lab setup.

Algorithms:
