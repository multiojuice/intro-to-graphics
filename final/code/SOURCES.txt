Summary:
    Most of my changes are in Materials, Application, Models. Small changes in Lighting and Viewing 
    and the addition of multiple files, models, and orchestrating more objects.


Files from earlier frameworks: 
    Unaltered:
        From Lab7:
            Application.h
            Canvas.cpp & Canvas.h
            Buffers.cpp & Buffers.h
            compmac
            inverse.glsl
            Lighting.h
            main.cpp
            Materials.h
            Models.h
            QuadData.h
            ShaderSetup.cpp & ShaderSetup.h
            Types.h
            Utils.cpp & Utils.h           

        From Lab6:
            TeapotData.h -> I just renamed the file and moved stuff around

        Course Website Meshes:
            Cube10.h
            Parts.h
            Sphere20.h
        
    Altered:
        Based on Lab7:
            Application.cpp
            Lighting.cpp
            Materials.cpp
            Models.cpp
            p150.vert -> phong.vert
            p150.frag -> phong.frag
                NOTE: I plugged in my version from lab6 and found that yours was slightly better at spanning the light across the Image
                    After realized my mistake, I fixed it. At this point we have nearly identical code, I mean it is an algorithm... I decided
                    to revert the change and stick with the implementation from lab7. I was feeling uneasy about my version being basically just 
                    variable name changes. We have already been graded on this algorithm in lab6 so yea.. Idk. I'd rather just use the source than
                    fix mine based off of it. Sorry I was kinda panicked about this decision, hopefully my reasoning makes sense, thanks. TLDR It 
                    was hard to use as simply a starting point and not just tweak var names. 

            texture.frag & texture.vert -> Based on the same version that I submitted for lab7
            Viewing.cpp


Image files: 
    flower.jpg -> https://pixabay.com/illustrations/floral-backdrop-pattern-flower-2985648/
    wood.jpg -> https://pixabay.com/photos/wood-floor-backdrop-background-1866654/

Object model files: 
    Basket.obj -> Created with Blender by hand with the help of some internet tutorials and friends that are familiar with the oddities of blender. 
        I got stuck in some weird selector mode for like 20 minutes lol. Then I parsed the .obj into BasketData.h similar to last lab setup.

Algorithms: 
    Finding surface normals out of three points used in Models.cpp::calculateNormals -> https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Calculating_a_Surface_Normal
    Attempt at adding shadows -> https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Shadows/Shadow-Mapping 
        I wanted to add shadows because it looks so fake without them. I tried for a bit and ran into multiple issues and wanted to focus on submitting.
        Not gonna lie, I was sad this didnt pan out
    Fabrics -> https://github.com/sam007961/FastMassSpring
        I wanted to look into how complex making a real fabric would be to put as the upholder of the basket and teapot.
        I didnt implement but it was an interesting read.
